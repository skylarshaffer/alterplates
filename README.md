# alterplates

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and TypeScript solo project used to offer intelligent suggestions for alternate vanity license plates.

## Description

Do you need vanity license plate suggestions based on a plate value that is already taken? Let alterplates think for you, using a responsive front-end site that suggests while you type and allows you to save your favorites.

## Usage

Just enter your original vanity license plate value and watch as alterplates fills with suggestions as you type.

Click on a suggested plate to add to Favorites, or clear existing favorites from the Favorites menu!
